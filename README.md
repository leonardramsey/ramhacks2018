# ramhacks2018
## Introduction:
This repository is developed by **Hong Jik "Henry" Lee, Leonard Ramsey, and Sanatkumar Kondhol** at RamHacks2018 (link: https://ram.hacks.vcu.edu/). The problem that we tried to address is to build a system that can help governments and donors track funds donated to non-profit organization. The project was inspired by the Markle Challenge specified [in the RamHacks devpost](https://ramhacks.devpost.com/). We like to call the project HSL FundTracker.
